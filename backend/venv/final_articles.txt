Before the parties signed on the dotted line, it got about 16% bigger. The deal will now inject up to $5.8 billion into Rivian\u2019s coffers with $1 billion already delivered via a convertible note.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t know all of the specific terms, but it is worth noting that this will be an independent company co-led by Rivian\u2019s head of software Wassym Bensaid and Volkswagen Group\u2019s chief technical engineer, Carsten Helbing. The team, which will be heavily loaded with Rivian engineers, will be based in Palo Alto, California. It will eventually set up three more sites in North America and Europe.\u00a0\nA lingering question \u2014 and one asked by lots of media (including moi) during a press conference \u2014 is what happens to VW\u2019s struggling software arm, Cariad? VW Group CEO Oliver Blume claims that Cariad will still play a \u201ccentral role.\u201d We\u2019ll see.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Rivian is still struggling with a supplier problem that curbed production and cut into revenue. In its Q3 earnings, Rivian reported $874 million of revenue, more than 34% lower than the same period last year. But looking at the gap between production (13,157) and deliveries (10,018) suggests that demand is also an issue.\nThat VW money is looking pretty sweet right now.\u00a0\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\nJust Eat Takeaway, the Netherlands-based food delivery company, is selling its U.S. business Grubhub to New York-based Wonder Group in a deal valued at $650 million. That\u2019s 91% less than the $7.3 billion Just Eat Takeaway paid for the company just four years ago.\nSilicon Valley battery startup Lyten is acquiring manufacturing assets from Northvolt, the Swedish battery manufacturer that has struggled in recent months and is short on capital. The companies didn\u2019t disclose financial terms but did say Northvolt will sell manufacturing equipment it inherited in its 2021 acquisition of Cuberg, another battery startup.\nNASA gave out five research awards worth $11.5 million to companies working on sustainable aircraft concepts, including JetZero.\nVatn Systems, a Portsmouth, Rhode Island-based company developing underwater autonomous vessels, raised $13 million in a seed round led by DYNE Ventures and with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, RTX Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and others. The round brings the startup\u2019s total funding to $16.5 million.\u00a0\nVecna Robotics, a warehouse robotics startup that developed autonomous forklifts and other pallet movers, has raised $14.5 million. But the raise wasn\u2019t exactly what got my attention; it was the appointment of Karl Iagnemma, the former president and CEO of Motional. Iagnemma has been in the AV world for a couple of decades now, largely in pursuit of commercializing autonomous vehicles (i.e., robotaxis). This new position puts him at the helm of a startup (in which he was an early investor, btw) that already has commercial customers.\u00a0\nMonarch Tractor, the autonomous electric tractor startup, has laid off workers as part of a restructuring that will see it prioritize non-agricultural customers, license its autonomous technology, and boost sales of its AI-powered farm management software. Got a tip about Monarch? Reach out to Sean O\u2019Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com.\nYelp agreed to buy RepairPal, a site for car repair estimates, for $80 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions.\nWaymo dropped its waitlist in Los Angeles, opening the robotaxi service up to the public. The service area is now about 80 square miles of Los Angeles County.\nWelp, Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson told us at Disrupt 2024 that the Amazon-backed company\u2019s custom robotaxi would be hitting the streets of San Francisco and Las Vegas. And now they have officially arrived. These are just for employees right now and will eventually be opened up to invited members of the public.\u00a0\nCanoo keeps trying to hold on, but its prospects don\u2019t look great. The EV startup-turned-SPAC told shareholders in its Q3 earnings \u201cit must continue to take aggressive actions to consolidate our operations, reduce costs, and catch-up to our plan.\u201d As part of that plan, Canoo\u2019s exec team, which includes chairman and CEO Tony Aquila and new CFO Kunal Bhalla, will take \u201cshort-term pay cuts for long-term incentives.\u201d Reminder: Aquila\u2019s firm has lent Canoo money, and among the terms is an 11% interest rate.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn other Canoo news, the company tested its electric vans for Walmart without airbags despite warnings from employees, sources told Fortune.\u00a0\nLucid started taking orders for the Gravity SUV. If it wasn\u2019t already clear, Lucid\u2019s future hinges on the success of this EV.\u00a0\nTesla issued a recall for more than 2,000 Cybertrucks, the sixth since the EV launched a year ago. And no, it\u2019s not one that can be fixed by a software update. Speaking of Tesla, the automaker is part of the trillion-dollar club (market cap) again thanks in part to shareholders betting a Trump presidency will benefit the company led by ally Elon Musk.\u00a0\nExosonic, a startup developing supersonic commercial air travel and UAV tech, said it is shutting down after failing to find the capital needed to continue operations.\u00a0\nThis week, I\u2019m back with a couple more Waymo robotaxi tales from TechCrunch staff members who had their first rides while in San Francisco for Disrupt 2024. As I mentioned last week, I\u2019ve been in loads of autonomous vehicles, including driverless Waymos, so I thought it would be fun to share some first-timers\u2019 views.\u00a0\nFrom UK-based reporter Paul Sawers: \u201cWhile I\u2019ve written about the autonomous vehicle industry for many years, taking my first ride in an actual self-driving car was pretty mind-blowing \u2014 it felt like I\u2019d been catapulted into the future. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at the empty driver\u2019s seat and marvel at the fact that we were maneuvering through the streets of San Francisco. It wasn\u2019t hugely nerve-wracking, but that\u2019s probably because we weren\u2019t going much faster than about 25 to 30 miles per hour. I suspect if I was on the highway in that thing, it might be a little more hairy.\nMore broadly, there was something a little jarring about seeing all these humanless cars creeping around street corners\u2014 marginally dystopian, like the machines were finally taking control.\u201d\nFrom reporter Rebecca Bellan: \u201cI rode in as many Waymos as I could during the week of Disrupt, and it felt sort of like a ride at Disneyland. It moved slow and cautiously, and I wasn\u2019t really worried about crashing. Most rides went without incident, barring one in which the robotaxi looked poised to drive towards a pedestrian but then thankfully swerved.\n\u201cMy main gripe is that the vehicles often began to drive off before you reached them, likely due to a lack of access to city curbsides. I\u2019m not sure how the \u2018Driver\u2019 decides it\u2019s time to drive half a block up and wait there instead, but this little exercise had my editor Kirsten and I chasing one down a couple of blocks and a (thankfully well-lit) alleyway before we could come aboard.\u201d\nSenior reporter Sean O\u2019Kane wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve covered AVs long enough that I expected my first taste of Waymo\u2019s careful rollout to go super smoothly \u2014 and it did. I did not expect to feel so viscerally just how expensive these current vehicles are, from the whirring lidars to the high-price I-Paces. I\u2019m excited to ride again someday soon, but I hope by then Waymo will have made more progress on making a viable business.\u201d\nWhat is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.\nTopics\n",
    "OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is starting to work with other apps on your computer.\nOn Thursday, the startup announced the ChatGPT desktop app for MacOS can now read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps, such as VS Code, Xcode, TextEdit, Terminal, and iTerm2.\nThat means developers will no longer have to copy and paste their code into ChatGPT, which has become a common way to use the chatbot. Now, when the feature is enabled, OpenAI will automatically send the section of code you\u2019re working on through its chatbot as context, alongside your prompt. \nHowever, unlike popular AI coding tools such as Cursor or GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT is currently unable to write code directly into developer apps on your behalf.\nThe feature, called Work with Apps, is far from an AI agent, but OpenAI says getting ChatGPT to understand other apps is a \u201ckey building block\u201d towards building agentic systems. One of the biggest challenges facing AI agents today is getting them to understand the rest of your computer screen, as opposed to prompts or their own responses.\nOpenAI says it\u2019s focusing this feature on coding apps to start; this is likely because AI coding assistants have taken off as one of the most popular use cases for LLMs. The feature is available to Plus and Teams users today, and will roll out to Enterprise and Edu in the next few weeks. OpenAI says ChatGPT will be able to work with other types of apps moving forward, specifically, text-based apps that could be used for writing tasks.\nIn a demo with TechCrunch, an OpenAI employee opened the ChatGPT app and an Xcode environment containing a simple project modeling the solar system \u2013 although it was missing the Earth. The employee selected an Xcode tab within ChatGPT, which tells the AI chatbot to look at the app, and prompted the chatbot to \u201cadd the missing planets.\u201d The chatbot was able to complete the task, writing a line of code to represent the Earth that matched the rest of the project\u2019s format. They still had to paste ChatGPT\u2019s answer back into their environment, though.\nIn order to read different apps, OpenAI is mostly relying on the MacOS Accessibility API to read text and translate it to ChatGPT, according to OpenAI desktop product lead Alexander Embiricos. MacOS\u2019s screen reader, which helps Apple\u2019s VoiceOver feature work, has been around for nearly two decades. It\u2019s generally considered pretty reliable for most common apps, but not everything.\nFor some apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s VS Code, Work with Apps requires users to install a special extension to query content. And, as the name suggests, Apple\u2019s screen reader can only read text, so it can\u2019t help ChatGPT understand visual elements \u2013 such as photos, the orientation of objects, or videos.\nWork with Apps with send your last 200 lines of code through ChatGPT alongside every prompt for certain apps. For others, all the code in your foremost window will be used as input for the chatbot. You can highlight sections of code or text to help ChatGPT focus on the right part of the project, but ChatGPT will also include text surrounding it. This all sounds like it will use a lot of input tokens.\nIt\u2019s unclear how OpenAI plans to branch this feature out to other apps that are not compatible with Apple\u2019s screen reader. Anthropic, one of OpenAI\u2019s competitors, released an AI system that analyzes screenshots of a user\u2019s desktop to understand and use other apps. To be frank, Anthropic\u2019s approach leaves a lot to be desired in its current state: it\u2019s slow and makes a lot of mistakes. However, it\u2019s a more general purpose version of an AI agent that doesn\u2019t rely on APIs, and can do more than just read text in another window.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t meant to be an agent, it\u2019s a way to collaborate with coding tools to start, and there will be more tools coming soon\u201d said OpenAI desktop product lead Alexander Embiricos in a briefing with TechCrunch. \u201cOn the side of agents, I think this is a really key building block. This idea that ChatGPT understands or can work with all the content that you have so that it can help with it.\u201d\nThis step towards agents is especially notable given recent reports that OpenAI is nearing the release of a general purpose AI agent, codenamed \u201cOperator,\u201d according to Bloomberg. The tool is expected to arrive in early 2025, and would rival other early attempts at general purpose AI agents, such as Anthropic\u2019s Computer use or Google\u2019s reported \u201cJarvis\u201d agent.\nOpenAI is first releasing these features on MacOS, shortly before Apple launches an integration with ChatGPT in December. It\u2019s unclear when Work with Apps will come to Windows, the operating system created by OpenAI\u2019s largest backer, Microsoft. \nTopics\n",
    "YouTube is launching a new way for creators to earn money during vertical livestreams, the company announced on Thursday. Viewers can now buy \u201cJewels,\u201d a digital currency, to send \u201cgifts\u201d to creators. Gifts are animations that appear on screen during vertical livestreams. \nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s similar to TikTok\u2019s live gifting feature that lets viewers purchase \u201ccoins\u201d to send gifts, of various monetary value, to support live creators during their streams. \nWhen viewers use Jewels to send gifts on YouTube, creators get \u201cRubies.\u201d Creators receive 1 cent for each Ruby, which means creators get $1 for 100 Rubies. Since the price for Jewels on YouTube can vary based on different bundle options, there isn\u2019t a fixed effective revenue share, which means the amount of Rubies earned can vary.\nFor the next three months, eligible creators can receive a 50% bonus on their gifts\u2019 earnings, up to $1,000 per month, in addition to their regular earnings from Rubies.\nCreators can only receive gifts when they stream vertically directly on YouTube or with third-party streaming software, and viewers can only send gifts through the mobile app.\nAlthough YouTube has allowed viewers to support livestreamers through \u201cSuper Stickers\u201d in the chat tab, this new feature is a direct response to the popularity of gifts on TikTok Lives. \nCreators on TikTok are earning thousands of dollars by going live and then receiving gifts from viewers. For instance, some teens earned up to $7,000 a month by arguing for or against Donald Trump against Kamala Harris in live battles on the platform. Plus, numerous NPC streamers have earned thousands of dollars, per day in some cases, by receiving gifts during livestreams.\nYouTube notes that once an eligible creator enables gifts on their vertical livestreams, they will no longer have access to Super Stickers. The Google-owned company says it believes gifts offer viewers a better way to visually support their favorite live creators.\nThe new monetization option is rolling out to eligible creators in the U.S. over the next few weeks. \nTopics\n"
